This is a [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) config repo for my Piantor keyboard.

The repo was initially forked from [Keebart](https://github.com/Keebart/zmk-config).

The in-code visualisation in the keymap file is inspired by [nickfaraco](https://github.com/nickfaraco/zmk-config).

The battery display is from [infely](https://github.com/infely/nice-view-battery).

The home row mod configuration and timings are inspired by [urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config)'s config.
